# Portable Launcher

🌍 **[简体中文](README-CN.md) | [English](README.md)**

The Portable Launcher is designed to set the `AppData`, `LocalAppData` and `UserProfile` environment variables for the target application before launch. This ensures that all data generated by the application is centralized, making it portable and easy to manage.

## How to Use

1. Choose the appropriate launcher based on the type of target application:
    - Window launcher for GUI applications
    - Console launcher for command-line tools
2. Place the launcher in the same directory as the target program.
3. Rename the launcher to `<TargetApplicationName>.launcher.exe`, where `<TargetApplicationName>` is the name of the application you wish to launch.
4. Execute the launcher to start your application with the new environment settings.
